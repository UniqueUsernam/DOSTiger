# DOSTiger
This project is meant for DOS penetration testing or learning how DOS attacks work. Leaving this running can put a lot of strain on your CPU, but can also strain the website you're targeting. There are several options to configure your DOS attack. This program is built using Python 3. To use it, just run it in the command line. DOSTiger was built for MacOS, so it may not work well on Windows.
Do not use this to actually attack somebody's website without permission. It's illegal and usually won't work...
